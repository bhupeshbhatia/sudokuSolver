## How does it work?

The solver uses backtracking and recursion to find a solution for the Sudoku puzzle. 

The solver (SolveSudoku function) tries to find the first empty cell (those with a `_`) and fills it with a number between 1-9 so long as it doesn't already occur in the corresponding row, column or 3x3 section. Then it moves to the next empty cell and inserts another number and so on.

If there is an issue (such as number already exists) and all possible values for the current cell has been tried then we move back to the previous one (which is called as backtracking). 

The same process is repeated until the board is finally solved.
